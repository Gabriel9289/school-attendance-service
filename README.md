Time-Bound Attendance Service

A backend-first attendance tracking system built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, designed to handle time-limited attendance sessions for classes.
Students submit attendance using a short-lived code generated by a teacher.

This project focuses on data modeling, validation, and API design, with authentication and role-based access planned as future iterations.

Core Features (Current)

Class creation (teacher-owned)

Time-bound attendance session generation

Short numeric attendance codes

Attendance submission with:

Expiration validation

Duplicate submission prevention

Active/inactive session handling

Clean separation between:

Database models (SQLAlchemy)

API schemas (Pydantic)

Business logic (FastAPI endpoints)

Tech Stack

Python 3.11+

FastAPI

SQLAlchemy

SQLite (local development)

Pydantic v2

Uvicorn

Project Structure (Current)

    ├── main.py          # FastAPI app + routes

Note: The project will be refactored into routers/services as authentication and complexity increase.

Data Models (Summary)
User

id (UUID string)

email (unique)

hashed_password

role (student, teacher, etc.)

Class

Owned by a teacher

Can have multiple attendance sessions

AttendanceSession

Time-bound

Short numeric code

Automatically expires

AttendanceRecord

One record per student per session

Prevents duplicate submissions

API Endpoints
Health Check
GET /health

Create Class
POST /classes

Create Attendance Session
POST /classes/{class_id}/attendance-sessions

Submit Attendance
POST /attendance/submit

Example Attendance Session Response
{
  "id": "642b6070-c615-45ff-828c-03bc72cb8b09",
  "code": "201797",
  "expires_at": "2026-01-13T16:51:56.162245"

Design Principles

Backend-first: Focus on data integrity and system behavior

Explicit validation: All inputs validated via schemas

No magic: Business rules are explicit and readable

Incremental complexity: Authentication and roles added step-by-step

Planned Next Steps

Password hashing utilities

JWT-based authentication

Role-based access control (student / teacher / admin)

Router and service-layer refactor

Attendance review endpoints

Status

This project is actively developed and intentionally scoped to evolve through small, well-defined iterations.
